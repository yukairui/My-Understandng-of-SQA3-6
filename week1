                                My Understanding of Software Quality Assurance 

   From the literal meaning, I think Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is a kind of software quality management to make 

sure that the software is inaccordance with software developing standards and software requirements.Software quality 

assurance monitors software projects mainly through the establishment of a series of tests and test strategies so that 

the developers can improve the projects in time.

   
   Different from the traditional testing, I think SQA should be done at the begining of the project and make 
   
appropriate plans in order to keep in accordance with the developers's plan and thinking.


   Software quality assurance should be implemented through the whole project, so that the higher management can 
   
control over the whole project developing process and documents' correction in time. Therefore, software quality 

assurance should have a series of formal technical review system to make sure of a correct execution of developing 

process in all domains.
