                                             Summary of the Second Week
                                             
     In the course of last week, we had a overview of QA and V&V in software processes and SQE-software quality 
     
engineering in the overall development. Defect handling is throughout the whole project process, in terms of 

defect prevention in the beginning of the process, defect removal in the testing phase and defect containment in

late phases. Besides, among distributed QA activities, defect containment activities are important for some 

critical or highly-dependable systems and data is essential for future QA activities. Therefore, core QA activities

are grouped into V&V, that is to say, the validation view. Mentioning SQE, we know that QA activities need additional

support such as planning and goal setting,management, data collection, and analysis and modeling. Therefore, software

quality engineer is deserved to emerge at its proper moment. SQE process includes making pre-QA planning, setting

quality goals, forming QA strategies and analysis and feedbacks until the quality goals are satisfied.
